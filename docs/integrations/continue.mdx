<LocalFocusTip />

Continue is an open-source AI code assistant that supports MCP servers, allowing you to extend Continue's agent with custom tools, resources, and prompts from your FastMCP servers.

<Info>
For detailed information about Continue's MCP implementation and configuration options, see the [Continue MCP documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/mcp).

## Requirements

This integration uses STDIO transport to run your FastMCP server locally. Continue MCP servers work in agent mode and are configured using YAML block files in the `~/.continue/mcpServers` directory.

## Create a Server

The examples in this guide will use the following simple dice-rolling server, saved as `server.py`.

```python server.py
import random
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="Dice Roller")

@mcp.tool
def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
    """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Install the Server

### FastMCP CLI

The easiest way to install a FastMCP server in Continue is using the `fastmcp install continue` command. This automatically handles the configuration and dependency management.

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py
```

The install command supports the same `file.py:object` notation as the `run` command. If no object is specified, it will automatically look for a FastMCP server object named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in your file:

```bash
# These are equivalent if your server object is named 'mcp'
fastmcp install continue server.py
fastmcp install continue server.py:mcp

# Use explicit object name if your server has a different name
fastmcp install continue server.py:my_custom_server
```

The command creates a YAML block file in `~/.continue/mcpServers/` named after your server (e.g., `my-server.yaml`). After installation, restart Continue to load the new server.

#### Dependencies

FastMCP offers multiple ways to manage dependencies for your Continue servers:

**Individual packages**: Use the `--with` flag to specify packages your server needs. You can use this flag multiple times:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --with pandas --with requests
```

**Requirements file**: For projects with a `requirements.txt` file, use `--with-requirements` to install all dependencies at once:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --with-requirements requirements.txt
```

**Editable packages**: When developing local packages, use `--with-editable` to install them in editable mode:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --with-editable ./my-local-package
```

You can also use a `fastmcp.json` configuration file:

```json fastmcp.json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  }
}
```

Then install it:

```bash
fastmcp install continue fastmcp.json
```

#### Python Version and Project Configuration

Control your server's Python environment with these options:

**Python version**: Use `--python` to specify which Python version your server should use. This is essential when your server requires specific Python features:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --python 3.11
```

**Project directory**: Use `--project` to run your server within a specific project context. This ensures `uv` discovers all project configuration files and uses the correct virtual environment:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --project /path/to/my-project
```

#### Environment Variables

<Warning>
Continue runs servers in a completely isolated environment with no access to your shell environment or locally installed applications. You must explicitly pass any environment variables your server needs.
</Warning>

If your server needs environment variables (like API keys), you must include them:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --name "Weather Server" \
  --env API_KEY=your-api-key \
  --env DEBUG=true
```

Or load them from a `.env` file:

```bash
fastmcp install continue server.py --name "Weather Server" --env-file .env
```

<Warning>
**`uv` must be installed and available in your system PATH**. Continue runs in its own isolated environment and needs `uv` to manage dependencies.
</Warning>

## Using the Server

Once your server is installed and Continue is restarted, you can start using your FastMCP server with Continue's AI agent.

<Note>
MCP servers only work in **agent mode** in Continue. Make sure to switch to agent mode before testing your server.
</Note>

Try asking Continue something like:

> "Roll some dice for me"

Continue will automatically detect your `roll_dice` tool and use it to fulfill your request.

The AI assistant can now access all the tools, resources, and prompts you've defined in your FastMCP server.

## Manual Configuration

For manual configuration or advanced use cases, you can create YAML block files directly in `~/.continue/mcpServers/`. Continue uses a composable block schema where each file contains an `mcpServers` array:

```yaml dice-roller.yaml
name: dice-roller
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: dice-roller
    type: stdio
    command: uv
    args:
      - run
      - --with
      - fastmcp
      - fastmcp
      - run
      - path/to/your/server.py
    env:  # Optional
      API_KEY: your-api-key
```

For detailed information about Continue's YAML block schema, configuration options, and remote server setup, see the [Continue MCP documentation](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/mcp).
